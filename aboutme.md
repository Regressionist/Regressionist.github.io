<i class="fa fa-institution"></i> Graduate Student at Center for Data Science, New York University


<span><i class="fa fa-code"></i> </span> I am passionate about extracting useful knowledge from data to solve business problems and formulating data mining solutions and evaluating the results in the context in which they will be used. I am also interested in deep learning and its application in computer vision and NLP


My name is Inigo Montoya. I have the following qualities:

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
