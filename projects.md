## Projects
1. **Face Detection and Recognition**: Designed a 8 layered CNN for person recognition and bounding box regression. Augmented the training dataset by horizontal flipping and adding gaussian noise to the images. Model achieved a classification accuracy (for recognizing the employee by employee ID) of 94% on test set and 0.71 IoU


2. **Flight Delay Prediction**: Worked in a team of three to design a model to predict flight delays for flights departing from JFK airport based on historical data of flight delays, past weather data and US Bank holidays data. Achieved 0.78 AUC using ensemble methods


3. **Recommendation system**: Implemented content based filtering and collaborative filtering methods to generate recommendations for existing users. Achieved RMSE value of 0.94 on the test set (MovieLens 20M dataset)


4. **Sentiment anlaysis**: Classified IMDB movie reviews as postive, negative or neutral using Naive Bayes, Logistic regression and Decision trees. Achieved AUC score of 0.926 and prediction accuracy of 85% on the test set


## Research experience
1. **Information processing in Genetic networks (Harvard Medical School)**: Modeled and simulated a gene regulatory network with positive and
negative feedback loops using Monte Carlo simulation and Principal Component Analysis. Statistical analysis and analytical calculations correlated strongly with the experimental observations


2. **Diagnostic kit optmization (IIT Delhi)**: Optimized the performance of a diagnostic device with respect to the concentration, temperature, and humidity. Applied nonlinear regression analysis on experimental data sets yielding $$R^2$$ values as high as 0.98
